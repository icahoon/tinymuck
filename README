README,v 2.3 1994/02/21 00:04:07 dmoore Exp

*** General:

This is a BETA release.  The server should be stable, but there currently
isn't much admin documentation.  Player documentation is available
online via 'help' and 'man'.  A player tutorial is available in
docs/Muck.man.txt.

You may want to look at the scripts in admin/scripts after you've
played with your server for a while.  There is a sample restart
script in the minimal-db directory which you may want to use.

IMPORTANT: if you are upgrading from 2.3pl2 to this version, your
	   database needs to be upgraded.  Use the provided script:
		./convert-pl2-to-pl3 ~/mud/tt/data/in.tt.new
	   For example.  It will make a backup of your database
	   in <db>.bak where <db> is the name you gave it.
	   Run the new sanity checker on this database to see how
	   it is.

IMPORTANT: if you are upgrading from 2.2 or the supported 2.2 derivatives
	   you must use the convert _program_ on your database.


*** Mailing list:

There is a mailing list for tinymuck servers at:

tinymuck-sloggers@tcp.com

To join the list send mail to:

majordomo@tcp.com with `subscribe tinymuck-sloggers' in the body.

It is recommended that all people trying the server join the mailing list.
This way you can be informed of new releases, get help and suggestions
for administration issues (like: 'aiee, my db seems to be corrupted' or
'hmm, what is a good way of purging old players).



*** Reporting bugs:

The author can be reached via dmoore@ucsd.edu.  Please include the string
'tmuck2.4' in the subject to ensure faster response to letters.  Send all
bug reports to this address.  An example of a good subject for a bug report
would be "fatal @open bug in tmuck2.4".  A bad subject would be "yo, ojay".

Include:

1.	E-Mail Address.
2.	What causes it?
3.	Where in source code, if known?
4.	Suggested fix, if you have one.



*** Deriviative works:

1. Should you make a substantial addition to this work and choose to
distribute it, please inform me first.  If that is not possible, in
your distribution, you should either:

	a) Not use the name TinyMUCK as the program, and note and
	acknowledge it's deriviative nature.

	b) Use the name TinyMUCK and it's version number, but append
	a suffix to distinguish it from the original.
	(Eg. tinymuck2.2fb is the name used by the fuzzball deriviative.)

2. You should distribute the source with the binaries (if binaries are
provided), and update the documentation to reflect the changes you
made.  If you are unable to do the latter, you must state the changes
in some way evident to the user when either running the software or
when unpacking the archive.

3. Inform me of any note-worthy uses of this software.



*** Thanks, and enjoy

David Moore
