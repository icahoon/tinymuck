Changes in TinyMUCK v1.1:

- Some of the bugfixes and modifications done by Scott C. Goehring
  ("Firefoot") have been added:
  o the 'has connected' and 'has disconnected' messages are optionally
    installed (-DCONNECT_MESSAGES in the Makefile)
  o the !-bug and pronoun-substitution bug have been fixed
  o the WHO list is tabular, but not reversed (ie., most recently
    connected players are at the top).  This is hard-coded; there
    are no additional player flags.
- a big bug in do_attach has been fixed, it now checks for ownership
  of the exit.
- the Typeof(thing) macro now checks for HOME and returns TYPE_ROOM, as it
  should, so @link exit=home should work properly on all platforms.

Changes in TinyMUCK v1.2

- New database format --- compatibility modes allowed, though.
- Property lists added.
- drop, odrop fields added.
- page now can include a message.
- locks can now be against properties too.
- Gender pronoun substitution code uses player's p-list instead.

Changes in TinyMUCK v1.2F (Incorporates Fire Foot's changes)

- ABODE && HAVEN flags optional
- God cannot be forced, have password changed, or unwizarded.
- Database read routines changed so that FireFoot's ABODE and HAVEN
  flags are either ignored or shifted to the new position.

- Sanity checker is back!
  Usage is:
	sanity <infile >report file

  The report file will tell you what the problem is as well as giving
  you the listing.

- Examine now does a "look" and also tells you who owns this object.

Changes in TinyMUCK 2.0

- @prog -- see "forth.ref" and "technical.doc"
- MUCKER bit must be set to use the above.
- sanity has been updated to just ignore programs when checking.
  It should eventually be updated to check program owners and such.
- m/ directory has been added to distribution --- this directory is
  used to contain MUF programs.  Hence, restart also "backs up"
  that directory by moving it to m.old before starting.
  This directory may contain junk.
- Changes in look, examine to reflect program changes.
- Change to trigger to reflect it.
- Change to game.c to test for interactiveness and act accordingly.
- Rest of changes concentrated in edit.c, compile.c, interp.c, inst.h
- wiz.c changed to update @stat command.
- do_get had to be added.
- concentrator "added"  Note that conc.c has been slightly changed
  from the original to run on nyquist.
  Same thing applies to interface3.c (it differs from Robert's
  original distributions)  Especially note that writelog has become
  #defined to printf.  (I don't know where it was originally.)
- #ifdefs for MIPS (Dec3100) stations.
- TRUENAMES modifications no longer show names when you look at a
  linkable player.

Changes in TinyMUCK 2.0.1

- Countless changes, see RCS log for info.
- This is primarily a bug fix release, though it also does several
  design changes that should be hidden.

Changes in TinyMUCK 2.1

- New commands: @boot, @edit, @list, @recycle (with -DRECYCLE), @pcreate
  (with -DREGISTRATION)
- We now have true recycling of objects, courtesy of jmattson@ucsd.edu,
  adding a new type, TYPE_GARBAGE, which is considered first
  before @create makes a new object.
- Extended WHO list for Wizards.  Shows players' numbers, flags, times,
  IP address, and game location.
- Exits may be set DARK by Wizards, to suppress the standard `has arrived.'
  and `has left.' messages.  This should cut down on noise in areas with
  osucc'ed exits.
- interp.c got a major makeover, thanks to jmattson@ucsd.edu and
  russ@uokmax.ecn.uoknor.edu.  Many #ifdefs replaced with a single #def.
  Thanks much.
- Changes in MUF:
- Command line arguments from russ@uokmax.ecn.uoknor.edu.  Many changes
  for the exit/action matching algorithm, enabling replacement of system
  commands as well.
- TRIGGER variable.
- RMATCH primitive.
- OWNER primitive.
- Six flag-reading primitives, JUMPP, CHOWNP, LINKP, DARKP, TEMPLEP, and
  STICKYP.  See MUF.manual (formerly forth.ref) for complete details.

In the version of MUF used by Muck 2.1, two MUF program words were changed
which will make many old MUF programs incompatible.  While this is somewhat
inconvenient, the changes save a lot of code space and CPU time, and also
make the language easier to understand since there is less swapping.
We felt that it would be better to make this change now, while there aren't
too many MUF programs out there, than to live with MUF being much less
efficient than it easily could be.

Those changes were:

The order of arguments to the "!" word have been reversed.
The order of arguments to "explode" have been reversed.

The MUF documentation has been updated to reflect the changes.

Changes in TinyMUCK 2.2

- New command: @trace.
- New feature: environments.  Allows global commands and allows builders
  to create their own theme areas.
- Bugs fixed: @boot, a few memory leaks, problems with the COMPRESS
  option, many more...
- Property list strings are now compressed with the COMPRESS option.
- Player name and primitive hash tables added for speed.
- Wizard WHO list has been changed again.  Options are numeric IP
  addresses and all player flags displayed, or hostnames minus player flags.
- Improved logging: logfiles are created in a separate directory and commands
  are kept separate from important system messages.
- Concentrator version 2.0 added.
- Another makeover for interp.c, including many speed enhancements.
  Thanks once again to jmattson@ucsd.edu.
- Changes in MUF:
- Programs can be triggered via the text fields of objects: the desc, succ,
  fail, and drop may run programs rather than display text to the user.
- Macros may be added by MUCKERs to a global pool usable by all
  programmers.  See edit help; while in the editor type 'h'.
- COPYOBJ bug fixed; COPYOBJ now deletes the pointer to actions the new
  object inherits from the old.
- Changed primitives: RMATCH handles players and objects correctly, in
  addition to matching appropriate exits/actions.  The six flag primitives
  from 2.1.1, JUMPP, CHOWNP, LINKP, DARKP, TEMPLEP, and STICKYP have
  been replaced by one FLAG? primitive.  FLAG? is able to read any flag
  the MUCK site has been set up with.  All other P primitives, for
  example ROOMP, PLAYERP, have been changed to question marks:
  ROOM?, PLAYER?.  CONTENTS no longer returns a list of things but
  the dbref of the first thing in the object's contents.  This list
  is then traversed by NEXT.
- New primitives: ELSE, OVER, PICK, PUT, ROT, ROTATE, GETLINK, PRONOUN_SUB,
  STRNCMP, STRCUT, STRLEN, INSTR, RINSTR, OK?, TIME, EXECUTE, EXITS,
  NEXT.

MUF primitives are described in detail in the MUF programmer's reference,
MUF.manual.  The quick reference should be available on-site as helpfile
forth.ref.
